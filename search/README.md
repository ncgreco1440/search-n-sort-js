# Searching 

*searching* is the process of finding a designated target within a pool of items, or determining that the designated target does not exist within the pool of items. This pool is often times known as the *search pool*.

In order to search for an object, we need to be able to compare a given object with another. The implementations of search algorithms need not be aware as to how to compare two objects, but just that it does compare two objects. The object's blueprints (class/prototype) should feature some mechanism that will deeply compare itself to another object of the same type.
